just like we use in Scanner input
from sardayash8308 to All Participants:
Then Scanner inherits InputStream?
from poojakukreti406 to All Participants:
why readline generates exception?
from KULWINDER singh JASPAL to All Participants:
ok
from Debasish pujapanda to All Participants:
why we write exception
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
so you arecalling object in line 12?

where will this file be saved - abc.txt
from poojakukreti406 to All Participants:

from shimpibhushan6  to All Participants:
will it store for each character we enter
from shimpibhushan6  to All Participants:
ok
from Santhosh Gupta to All Participants:
in  place of '@' , can we write equivalent ascii number sir? 
from Santhosh Gupta to All Participants:

why ch=dis.read() does not give error as ch is int and we are giviing input string?
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
sir sorry i still have doubt on 9 and 10
from sardayash8308 to All Participants:
yes
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
what is dis and fos
from Debasish pujapanda to All Participants:
line 10 ??
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
its like object?
from sardayash8308 to All Participants:
so it means it is convertying each character into ascii value and then again into char while comparing?

why do use type casting? not getting
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
why we use file ouptut stream as we are writing which is input
from sardayash8308 to All Participants:
could we write DataInputStream dis = System.in like we had done for PrintStream pis = System.out?
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
writing in a file is input
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
ok in abc.txt the coversion is automatic
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
and we are using file output stream
from Ashish Prakash Idhol to All Participants:
in file we get charachetr only not currensponding value ascii?
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
oh
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
okay
from Raja Rajeswari Jayachandran to All Participants:
Everytime it creates a new file?

could we print the data of file input stream on console?

but -1 could be there in file... how to each the end of file then?
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
so what if the file it self has -1 value?
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
ok
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
-1 is the ascii code
from Debasish pujapanda to All Participants:
if w write randomly -2 is it error ??

file with passwrd?
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
ok so the file type has to be same
from poojakukreti406 to All Participants:
we can copy only same type of files?
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
ok 
from sardayash8308 to All Participants:
how to provide password?
from Durga Prasad Gutti to All Participants:
fis.read() method will read Byte by Byte.. that means since a character is two bytes then for reading one character fis.read() will be called twice right?

for copying dff type of file we have another class?
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
if its notepad this will not happen, it will display properly in console?

ok sir
from Dipali Patil to All Participants:
it is use to conver string to primitive data type only
from Jagrut Goenka to All Participants:
got it sir
from Santhosh Gupta to All Participants:
generally typecasting is done for same type...!!

where can this not be used compared to byte wise?
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
ok
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
maybe full path
from Durga Prasad Gutti to All Participants:
do we need to flush at the end

char wise read 2 bytes per time and we are checking only one byte each time in the while loop. Right?
from Raja Rajeswari Jayachandran to All Participants:
ok
from SAURABH KAWATRA to All Participants:

sir before we were storing the value in file what are we doing here , gettibg the values from file?
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
for this also marker interface is mandatory?
from Jagrut Goenka to All Participants:
sir what it is mainly used for
from Jagrut Goenka to All Participants:
?
from Durga Prasad Gutti to All Participants:
So in this way we can only store one object in a file
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
ok the stored object, serialized ones
from sardayash8308 to All Participants:
how to store different objects in a same file and then retriving it correctly?
from SAURABH KAWATRA to All Participants:
true we can give?
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
sir one more question 
this process of storing is called serialization

from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
so sir who all can do desearialization? 
from Jagrut Goenka to All Participants:
yes sir
from Daniel Malkowski to All Participants:
yes
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
yes go tthat but who all can do this deserialization 
from SAURABH KAWATRA to All Participants:
clear
from Debasish pujapanda to All Participants:
yes
from Sankari.s  to All Participants:
what is deserilazation
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
sir i got the concept , but my question was who call have access to this deserialized file
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
so same program has to do it?
from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
ok
from Nivrutti Shalik Patil to All Participants:
can it be possible to write multiple object in single file
from Nivrutti Shalik Patil to All Participants:
ok sir
from SAURABH KAWATRA to All Participants:
Doubt in buffered...if we close the buffer in between the program it always throw exception after re opening
from SAURABH KAWATRA to All Participants:
ok
from Jagrut Goenka to All Participants:
yes si

from mailmevinaya to All Participants:
what are these difeerent sort?
from poojakukreti406 to All Participants:
we use all these techniques in aplln development??

FILO
from poojakukreti406 to All Participants:
ok sir.
from Jagrut Goenka to All Participants:
sir it could be the case if we use one sorting technique in 1 language the same sorting techinque need more time in another language

from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
you have used duplicates

from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
hs1
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
ok
from Anurag Kumar to All Participants:
400 400

these are the only methods for hashset
